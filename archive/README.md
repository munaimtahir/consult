# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation and legacy files that are no longer actively used but are preserved for reference.

## Purpose

The archive serves as a reference repository for:
- Historical development plans and status reports
- Deployment logs and completion reports
- Build instructions and setup guides that may no longer be current
- Implementation summaries from past development phases

## Structure

```
archive/
├── historical-docs/     # Historical documentation, status reports, and plans
└── README.md           # This file
```

## When to Archive

Files should be moved here when they:
- Are historical status reports or progress updates
- Document completed milestones or one-time setup processes
- Contain information that is no longer current but may be useful for reference
- Are superseded by newer documentation

## Active Documentation

For current, active documentation, see:
- `/README.md` - Main project documentation
- `/docs/` - Current technical documentation
- Individual component READMEs in `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `mobile/` directories

## Note

Files in this directory are **preserved, not deleted**. They may contain valuable historical context about the project's development journey.
